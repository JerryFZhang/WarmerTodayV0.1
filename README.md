# This is a part of \#100DaysOfCode Challange.
Warmer apps (iOS, Web and possibly Android) are part of  [Alexander Kallaway's](https://github.com/Kallaway) [\#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.wbpxpj2f5) Challange where I have to code for at least one hour for the next 100days, not limited to warmer app but I will mostly be working on this.

All the code completed in this period of time will be opensourced on github(except for any kinds of authentication code and passwords).

Tracking will be done by [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/@zhang96).

Updates will be posted on [github](https://github.com/zhang96) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/fengwei_ca).
